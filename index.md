## Welcome
We are excited to announce the launch of our local OWASP chapter OWASP Sivagangai, dedicated in empowering the community in the rapidly evolving fields of AI and application security. As technology advances, the intersection of artificial intelligence and cybersecurity presents both opportunities and challenges. Our mission is to provide a platform for learning, collaboration, and innovation, ensuring that our community is equipped with the knowledge and skills necessary to secure AI-driven applications and protect sensitive data.

Whether you are a seasoned professional or just beginning your journey in AI and security, our chapter offers a welcoming environment for networking, knowledge-sharing, and professional growth. Through regular meetups, workshops, and collaborative projects, we aim to foster a strong, security-focused community that stays ahead of emerging threats and embraces the potential of AI in creating more secure and resilient systems.

Join us as we work together to explore cutting-edge topics, share best practices, and contribute to the global effort to secure our digital future. Together, we can make a difference in the world of AI and application security!
